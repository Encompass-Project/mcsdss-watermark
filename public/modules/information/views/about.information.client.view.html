          <h5>A Multi-Criteria Spatial Decision Support System</h5>
          <p>The use of multi-criteria spatial decision support systems (MCSDSS)—an integration of geographical information systems (GIS), decision support systems (DSS), and multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) — has emerged as a decision aid approach for evaluating conflicting objectives and stakeholder preferences in the implementation of spatial decision models.</p>
          <p>This research presents an open-source tool that supports a spatial decision-making process by providing better access to information, increased ease of public participation, and support for distributed collaboration amongst various groups of stakeholders in remote environments.</p>
